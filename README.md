# Flask - 30 Exercises

Welcome to my Flask web development practice repository!  
This project contains 30 exercises designed to help me master Flask backend development and Jinja templating through practical, component-based challenges.

## About

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework, and Jinja is its expressive templating engine.  
This repository is a hands-on learning space where I build a variety of web components and templates, progressing from simple static pages to dynamic, database-driven applications.
